# Create a Python program that takes two integers as input and prints their sum, product, and quotient using variables.
a = int(input("Enter first no:"))
b = int(input("Enter Second no:"))
sum = a + b
product = a * b
quotient = a / b 
print("Sum of two no's:",sum)
print("Product of two no's:",product)
print("Quotient of two no's:",quotient)
